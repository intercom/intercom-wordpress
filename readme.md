# Intercom / WordPress

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intercom/intercom-wordpress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intercom/intercom-wordpress)

# Compatibility

Requires PHP 5.6 or higher.

# Local Testing

Running tests requires [phpunit](https://phpunit.de/).

```php
INTERCOM_PLUGIN_TEST=1 phpunit
```

# Usage

Installing this plugin provides a new Intercom settings page.
Authenticate with Intercom to retrieve your app_id and Identity Verification secret.

Once authenticated, the Intercom widget will automatically appear on your site.

NB: This plugin injects a Javascript snippet on your website frontend containing dynamic user data. Some caching solutions will cache entire pages and should not be used with this plugin. Doing so may cause conversations to be delivered to the wrong user.

# Pass extra parameters to the Intercom Messenger

Using the [WordPress Hooks API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API) `add_filter` method in your WordPress theme you can pass extra parameters to the Intercom Messenger (see example below):

```php
add_filter( 'intercom_settings', function( $settings ) {
  $settings['user_id'] = $user_id;
  return $settings;
} );
```


# Users

If a `$current_user` is present, we use their email as an identifier in the widget.
We recommend enabling [Identity Verification](https://docs.intercom.com/configure-intercom-for-your-product-or-site/staying-secure/enable-identity-verification-on-your-web-product) in the settings page.
