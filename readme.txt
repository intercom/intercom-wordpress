The official WordPress plugin, built by Intercom.

Chat with visitors to your website in real-time, capture them as leads, and convert them to customers.

== Description ==

[Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/) is a fundamentally new way for internet businesses to communicate with customers, personally, at scale. It's a customer communication platform with a suite of integrated products for every team – including sales, marketing, product, and support. Our products enable targeted communication with customers on your website, inside your web and mobile apps, and by email.

With this plugin, you can add the Intercom Messenger to your website in just a few clicks and start chatting to customers and visitors to your website right away.

Your logged-in customers will be tracked in Intercom as users, and visitors who aren’t customers (or aren’t logged in) will be tracked as leads.

== Installation ==

Installing Intercom on your WordPress site takes just a few minutes.

You can find full instructions on signing up and installing Intercom using the WordPress plugin [here](https://docs.intercom.io/install-on-your-product-or-site/other-ways-to-get-started/install-intercom-on-your-wordpress-site).

If you’re already an Intercom customer, you can also find instructions in the in-app [setup guide](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/platform/guide) or [app store](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/appstore?app_package_code=wordpress&search=wordpress). The first thing you’ll need to do is install and activate the plugin - you must be using WordPress v4.2.0 or higher and have the ability to install plugins in order to use this method.

Note: This plugin injects a Javascript snippet on your website frontend containing dynamic user data. Some caching solutions will cache entire pages and should not be used with this plugin. Doing so may cause conversations to be delivered to the wrong user.
