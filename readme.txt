Official Intercom WordPress plugin: Engage visitors in real time, power growth with AI, and convert leads into loyal customers.

== Description ==

[Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) is a next-generation customer communications platform that combines powerful live chat, proactive messaging, and advanced AI solutions — like our Fin AI chatbot — to help businesses instantly connect with customers.

By installing the Intercom WordPress plugin, you can seamlessly add the Messenger to your site, track both logged-in users and visitors, and engage them right away. With Intercom’s industry-leading AI at your fingertips, you’ll deliver fast, personalized support and drive growth more effectively than ever before.

== Installation ==

Installing Intercom on your WordPress site takes just a few minutes.

You can find full instructions on signing up and installing Intercom using the WordPress plugin [here](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/173-install-intercom-on-your-wordpress-site).

If you’re already an Intercom customer, you can also find instructions in the in-app [setup guide](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/platform/guide) or [app store](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/appstore?app_package_code=wordpress&search=wordpress).

The first thing you’ll need to do is install and activate the plugin - you must be using WordPress v4.9.0 or higher and have the ability to install plugins in order to use this method.

Note: This plugin injects a Javascript snippet on your website frontend containing dynamic user data. Some caching solutions will cache entire pages and should not be used with this plugin. Doing so may cause conversations to be delivered to the wrong user.
